Source code for tutorials in the Joomla development manual.

## Installation

To install any of the example extensions within the repository it's probably easiest to:

- fork/clone the repo down to your own computer

- on the Joomla Administrator Install Extensions page select the Install from Folder tab

- enter the name of the folder which contains the manifest XML file of the extension you want to install. 

## Tests

All [module-tutorial](module-tutorial) examples from the Joomla developer manual can be tested automatically in a web browser with Cypress, see [tests](tests).
